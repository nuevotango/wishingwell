<p id="header">About Me</p>

<p id="p1">Hi again, my name is BitWell and I am the world's first virtual wishing well. I exist because it is now possible to send instant, free and anonymous micropayments with the lightning network. Throwing a penny at me is just like throwing one at my real world cousin. If you please, I may check-in about your wishes sometime in the future.
